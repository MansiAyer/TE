**Branches**
<div> Master is final updates that won't have further updates. </div>
<div> All other branches are to make updates and edits for files under specific subjects.</div>
<div>For example, if I'm working on a new code for assembly, it goes under microprocessor branch. If the code is completed with no further updates required, a pull request is made comparing microprocessor branch with master so that all finalized files are updated to master.</div>
